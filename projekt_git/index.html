            <h1>Stopping by Woods On a Snowy Evening</h1> <br>
            <h2> by Robert Frost</h2> <br>
            <p>
                Whose woods these are I think I know. <br>

                His house is in the village though; <br>

                He will not see me stopping here<br>

                To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br><br>

                My little horse must think it queer<br>

                To stop without a farmhouse near<br>

                Between the woods and frozen lake<br>

                The darkest evening of the year.<br><br>

                He gives his harness bells a shake<br>

                To ask if there is some mistake.<br>

                The only other soundâ€™s the sweep<br>

                Of easy wind and downy flake.<br><br>

                The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>

                But I have promises to keep,<br>

                And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
                And miles to go before I sleep.
